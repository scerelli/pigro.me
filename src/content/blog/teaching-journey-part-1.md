Growing up as a 90s kid, I was blessed with the luxury of gradually growing alongside technology. My afternoons were filled with boundless curiosity, delving into the enchanting world hidden within circuits and screens. The magic of technology wasn't just a backdrop to my childhood; it became a core part of my identity.

This journey began in the most unexpected of ways â€“ with a computer from my father, which I promptly disassembled. My explorations were not without consequences; many mornings, my father would leave for work only to return to a dismantled PC or a completely changed operating system. 

My early adventures, especially my dive into Linux when I was ~12 years old (I was attracted by the chameleon of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)  :'D), were not mere moments of rebellion but milestones of discovery, even though were marred with lost documents and steep learning curves.

<br />

Reflecting on my past, I see a stark contrast with today's generation. The enchantment I experienced is now a constant part of children's lives, yet the fascination to explore and understand technology's inner workings seems diminished. This rapid evolution of technology, juxtaposed with the diminishing time for reflection sparked a simple realization within me.

<br />

Having been fortunate enough to turn my passion into a career as a software engineer, I've witnessed first-hand the joy and impact of learning through fun. Yet, there was something missing: the direct transmission of curiosity and knowledge that technology uniquely fosters.  

<br />

This year marked a pivotal change in my life: I decided to dedicate some of my time to teaching, "stepping away" from the digital world to engage directly with the generations that will shape the world when I will be an old man. My initiative isn't about becoming an influencer or a content creator, but it is about making a tangible difference in a local school in the city where I live, Turin (Italy), working with children who may not have the same opportunities I was fortunate enough to have and in a political system that does everything in its power to go against the youngest generations.

<br />

Starting with a single fourth-grade class, I aim to recreate the sense of wonder I felt as a child. The journey,  I will shape up together with my co-pilots students and teachers, will encompass hands-on experiences with computers, an exploration of computational thinking, and an understanding of the significant role we play in using and shaping up technology. This project is not just about teaching; it's about sharing a journey of discovery, responsibility, and creativity.  

<br />

I must extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maestra Giorgia and Elena, that who believed in this project and without whom this journey would not have been possible. Their support not only has enabled this initiative, but has also made it a transformative experience for both the students and myself. Through this blog, I plan to document our experiences, challenges, and achievements. The ultimate goal is to create an open and free framework for anyone who wishes to embark on a similar venture, be it either with their children, students, or for personal enrichment.

I hope you'll choose to accompany me on this journey, where the real adventure lies in sharing  for growing. I eagerly await your feedback and your insights as we embark on this path.
